Directional Changes Framework

Implement a directional change framework with empirical evidence based on the algorithm according to the literature[1]. I introduce another function to obtain a more accurate point of directional change and the end of overshoot.

## Results

GBPCHF (20220301-20220331)

Figure 1: events of directional changes and overshoots

Figure 2: backtesting a strategy by dc framework within/out transaction fee.
